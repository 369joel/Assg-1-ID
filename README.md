My Portfolio Project

This project contains my skills, competencies and interests relating to coding and myself. It also showcases portfolio of the projects I have done so far to give me the best chance of getting recruited by recruiters. It also contains my basic personal information and contact information for the recruiters to contact me.

Design Process:
As an aspriring coder and web designer, I want to showcase my skills to bigger companies so that I will be able to get recruited by them and embark on bigger projects so I can be one of the best in my field. This project focuses on mainly being easy to navigate so recruiters will have the most convenient access to information which increases my chance of getting recruited such as my previous projects or my skills. By providing evidence of my previous projects being authentic to back up my claims of being competent at coding and web design, this will give me the best chance of getting hired for a job.

Features:

Horizontal Navigation Bar - Allows website visitors to easily access different parts of the website, by having them click on each of the different words to bring them to the respective pages.

Plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
For the content page to have a navigation list for each category(e.g skills,interests) so that when the content becomes too much the user does not need to scroll too much.

Features Left to Implement:
Drop down list for mobile view to navigate around the page.
